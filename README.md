# Project Description:

Perfect Lips is a platform where it brings lipstick connoisseurs together to talk about their most favorite subject. Fellow lipstick fans can leave reviews for various
lipsticks from any brand and can collect information from multiple users about what's worth being in their makeup collection. Once a user finds a post they deem as collection worthy, they have the option to store this post in a collection on the collection page. A post can find itself in two different collections, which are favorites or wishlist. This app is the perfect place to show off your review of lipstick products and to gain intel before walking into a store clueless about what lipstick product might be best for you.
